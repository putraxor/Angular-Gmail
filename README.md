This is an angular service for interacting with Gmail. 

First head over to cloud.google.com and sign in with your Google Account. You can either create a new project or select an excisting project. Then, go into the API manager for the project and enable the Gmail API. Next you will have to generate javascript credentials for the Gmail API for you to use with the Google Client Library. You will also likely have to do some configuring for your consent screen at this part as well.  

Remeber, this file is indented and commented to help you undrestand what is going on, you should probably want to minify before including in your own project for performance reasons.
